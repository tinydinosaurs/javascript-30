# javascript30

I, like many of my peers, am taking Wes Bos' Javascript 30 challenge. This is the repository where those projects live.

....with one exception. The first project, Javascript Drum Kit, is in a separate repository. Actually, mine isn't a drum kit. It's a [Javascript Drum Kitty 🐈](https://tinydinosaurs.github.io/javascript-drum-kitty/). Have fun with that.
